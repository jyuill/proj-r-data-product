Based on Coursera course: 'Developing Data Products'

Also uses book 'Developing Data Products' (ddp.pdf)

Basic points:
- need to have 2 files in same folder to run:
  - ui.R
  - server.R
- those are only allowed names
- for multiple examples, create separate folders with a ui.R and server.R file in each
